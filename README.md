# Breathalyzer-

I created this device to keep everyone safe at a low cost 

This device is not 100% accurate 

The accuracy depends on the voltage used to power device and sensor
Airflow also matters with readings
I have found its best to breathe into rather then blow 

I have used 4xaa rechargeables battery's to power device externally was being powered by 3xaaa internally with external options via dc jack or usb 

Fine tune readings as u use use for Tru accuracy
